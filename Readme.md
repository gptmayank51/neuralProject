Refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7xjL_JY67I2hvgwg0EhcMkx8SOo7l3I7qNOWjNT-cY/edit?usp=sharing) for further documentation of the progress

To run the code -
 - Create a folder - 'dataTest' in the directory previous to the directory where you have stored your code.
 - Run test.m from matlab

It will generate samples wise data outputs in a new folder - 'dataTestOutput' in the same directory as 'dataTest'.
Finally combined patient wise data will be created in 'MatFiles' in the same directory as 'dataTest'.
test.m will pick this data and run LibSVM on it and generate results.
